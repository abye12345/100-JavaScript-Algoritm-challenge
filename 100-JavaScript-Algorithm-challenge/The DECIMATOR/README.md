40. Write a DECIMATOR function which takes a string and decimates it (i.e. it removes the last 1/10 of the characters)

Always round up: if the string has 21 characters, 1/10 of the characters would be 2.1 characters, hence the DECIMATOR removes 3 characters. The DECIMATOR shows no mercy!

- Example DECIMATOR ("1234567890") âžž "123456789"

  // 10 characters, removed 1.
